# ETL-Retail-Orders-Project


## 🚀 Overview
This project is a part of my **Cloud Data Engineering** learning journey, where I built an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** to process retail order data. The goal was to extract data from Kaggle, clean and transform it using Python, and load it into **SQL Server** for further analysis. This project helped me understand the end-to-end ETL workflow and improve my skills in **Python and SQL**.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Extract:** Fetched retail order data using the **Kaggle API**.
- **Transform:** Cleaned, processed, and optimized the dataset using **pandas**.
- **Load:** Stored the refined data into **SQL Server** for querying and analysis.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, requests)
- **Kaggle API**
- **SQL Server**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## ⚡ How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/akhtarcloudx/ETL-Retail-Orders-Project.git
   cd Retail-Order-ETL
   ```
2. **Set Up Kaggle API**  
   - Download your Kaggle API key from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).  
   - Place the `kaggle.json` file in  `C:\Users\YourUsername\.kaggle\` (Windows).  

## 📊 Insights & Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience with the **ETL process**.
- Strengthened my **Python (pandas) and SQL** skills.
- Learned how to use the **Kaggle API** for data extraction.
